            <p>Trying to do this project with little to no help 
                using the resources I've learned in class and other projects.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Has Its Challenges</strong></h3>
            <p>As a novice, there is a lot of information to take in and understanding that I still need work on.
                I know with practice and "You should be coding" mentality I will succeed.
            </p>
            <h4><strong>The Resources Are at Our Fingertips</strong></h4>
            <p>With Mr. Cruz, TA's, classmates, and information from the Web, we can only fail at our own accord.
